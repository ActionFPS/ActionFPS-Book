# FAQ

## How do we know what to play next?

Look at the tournament's Challonge page.

## Where do we communicate / set up the match?

Discord.

## How do we enter the scores?

You don't, they are entered automatically.

## Why no mixed teams?
We want to build up the clan scene in ActionFPS and decrease the noise. Ideally more in number, smaller in size, higher in quality clans.

## Previously discussed issues
* Map blocking (https://github.com/ScalaWilliam/ActionFPS/issues/247)
