## Setting up a tournament checklist
1. Set up a Challonge page
2. Give administrator access to 'WoopDrakas' -> Advanced Options -> Permissions
3. Create a sign up Form (Google Forms good for that; use the original sign up form for reference)
4. Post about it on the Blog: https://actionfps.blogspot.sg/
5. Update tournaments.html in GitHub
6. Update Headings in ActionFPS Management page
7. Announce it on Discord channel
8. Announce it on AssaultCube Forums
9. Announce it to one or two clans
10. Announce it on ActionFPS Google Group

### Problems with sign up page
Users enter their own clan names and not clan IDs, so before starting the tournament you must fix them
Also it's a bit less transparent than Google Forms for the administrator.

Google Forms on the other hand doesn't integrate so well.

### AC Forum template
