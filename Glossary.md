**Inter**: A game between skilled players on a private server. Typically 3vs3 but may be 2vs2 or 4vs4.<br>
If you are a registered player on our server, you can type `!inter` to notify others that you want to play.

**Clanwar**: Two or three games played in sequence between two clans on one server. Third game is usually a tie-breaker.

**Validated game**: Game has to have more than 2 players per team at the end. So don't leave the game until next map starts, or use `/mastermode 2` (match mode).
