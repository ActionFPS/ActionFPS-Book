## Youtube

Yes, get videos via YouTube API. Simply look for videos that contain "woop.ac" or "actionfps.com".

Possible routes:
* Automatic sync & extraction
* Get notifications from YouTube subscription & publish to some spreadsheet by hand, which then propagates it all out
* Whatever you want. So long as it does not touch the existing game code, and so long as videos are available for any resource (user, game, etc).

## Twitch

Allow users to set their twitch stream.
When they are connected to a server (should work for players AND spectators), AF should query twitch API to check if their Twitch channel is live. If yes, a clickable twitch icon should appear on the live game card. "Featured streams" should appear on the main page itself during tournaments.
