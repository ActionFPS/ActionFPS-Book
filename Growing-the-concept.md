Crucial to think about **new user flow**:
> I'm a newbie and open this site. How and why do I end up playing the game, and coming back again?

We must optimise the living lights out of that.

We take the agile incremental approach: work against what makes sense now, not what makes sense in 2 years time.

Achievements were really useful at the beginning, but they are too fine grained and at some point there'll be so many they won't mean anything any more. Clan wars on the other hand were infrequent but in future there'll be many more.

Just like introducing this concept, we have to go through some ephemeral, temporary, transitive stages.

We aim to sustainably grow, both with the amount of input we put in and the amount of people we attract. 

Here's some old work on Clanwars: https://drive.google.com/a/vynar.com/file/d/0B7BXpjZMKCAIb3RsS2c5SG94TVk/view

Currently as a new player I'll have no idea what anything means, and even if I do manage to download the game still I'm left clueless as to what it all is about.

We need to start adding guides for new players. How to start a Clan, how to meet people. Cause it's really about meeting people and playing with them, not just shooting random stuff.

In that way we'll never be like QL where you open & shoot, we'll be much more organised and addictive.

Need to show off our strong points, eg Discord activity.

Implement a minimal concept, merge to master, keep on iterating.


Minimise the bounce rate first of all, then think of big grand ideas.
