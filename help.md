## What's the difference between ActionFPS and AssaultCube?

There are quite a few, as explained in the [Tutorial.](//tutorial.md) However, here's a more comprehensive list for those who already know AssaultCube:

### There is an authentication system based on ActionFPS:

* This means no more anonymous players, which means no more blacklists.
* The authentication system is distributed, so not prone to masterserver downtime.
* It comes with integrated group \("clan"\) support, meaning you can easily create clanwars and also be a member of multiple groups. No more messing with nickname tags.

#### No more admin passwords:

* It is developed closely with ActionFPS portal in mind
* This means that we'll be able to deliver ecosystem-wide features more quickly.
* With the authentication system, we will be able to reduce the code size required to detect players, and improve the quality of parsing.
* We will make the game logs more easily parseable, meaning easier development of new competitive features.

### Game binaries are built automatically, and code is continuously tested:

* This eventually means higher quality of releases and much easier to give feedback.
* We figured out how to build automatically for Mac, with a Circle CI subscription.

### It is built by the people behind the Match Client \(Lucas\)

* This means we will have all the competitive game features such as pause, half-time, map blocking, etc.
