## I'd like to talk to you

<div>Join us on Discord! </div>

Find us at our [Discord](https://discord.gg/YB35KE3)

## Which servers do you record from?

See the [servers](https://actionfps.com/servers/) page.

## Any rules for play?

Be fair.

## What are your plans?

Expand. We want your participation.

## What is the MatchClient?

The MatchClient is a custom client we made to better suits the needs of clanwars. With it you will be able to access compatible servers that support features like `/pause`!

## Why should I [register](https://actionfps.com/login/)?

When registering, it creates your profile page where you can find statistics about all your games on our servers. You will also unlock achievements while playing!

## Why Google sign in?

Saves us time in development.

## Can I change the in-game name i picked while registering?

In the current state you are not able to change it. However if the name change is necessary (i.e joined or left a clan..) then you can complete this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10DqKjc8YxnpQ7llI2E2AT4ceYtypzZg0d5LD4lRTe0E/viewform) and we will do it for you.

## Why are some games circled with blue on the frontpage?

This means that the games are happenning right now ! The real time game display allows you to see the score of a game in real time on your browser!

## Why do some games not appear on the site?

There are a number of reasons a game can be filtered from the site. In particular, games that have uneven number of players by the end of the match are not registered. To avoid this, do not leave the match until the intermission ends (i.e. the next map starts), or use `match` mastermode (`/mastermode 2`).

## Should I accept notifications?

Yes! When you are registered on the website, you are able to use an inter finding feature we created. Go on any of our [servers](https://actionfps.com/servers/), then type `!inter`. This will send a notification on people's browser with a link to join the inter. There is a spam protection, doing it once is enough.

## How to complete a Clan War?

In order to complete a Clan War, you need to play at least 2 consecutive games against the same clan. Moreover, if these games resulted in 2 ties or 1 win for both clans, a third game has to be played as a tie breaker.

## How can I support the project?

By registering and playing ! You can also post your ideas and feedback on the forum. Don't hesitate to report any [issue](https://github.com/ScalaWilliam/ActionFPS/issues) you have. If you are willing to be actively participating in the development then join on on Gitter!
