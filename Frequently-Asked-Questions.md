## What is this?

ActionFPS is a portal and a game based on AssaultCube.

## Rules for play?

Be fair.

## What is a Clanwar?

See [[Glossary]].

## Why Google sign in?

Fast development.

## Can I change the in-game name i picked while registering?

In the current state you are not able to change it. However if the name change is necessary (i.e joined or left a clan..) then you can complete this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10DqKjc8YxnpQ7llI2E2AT4ceYtypzZg0d5LD4lRTe0E/viewform) and we will do it for you.

## Why do some games not appear on the site?

There are a number of reasons a game can be filtered from the site. In particular, games that have less than two players on a team by the end of the match are not registered. To avoid this, do not leave the match until the intermission ends (i.e. the next map starts), or use `match` mastermode (`/mastermode 2`).
