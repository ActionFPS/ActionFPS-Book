## Competitive

Anything to do with participation itself

### Playing

This one is obvious. The more you plan, and perhaps at more important times, the better.

### Running tournaments

We already have a self-service [Tournaments](//tournaments.md) system to make your life easier.

### Running clans

Clans are essential to the well being of a game. They participate in tournaments.

## Promotional

Facing the external world.

### Videos

We already have a few collections:
