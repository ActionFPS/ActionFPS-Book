Yes, get videos via YouTube API. Simply look for videos that contain "woop.ac" or "actionfps.com".

Possible routes:
* Automatic sync & extraction
* Get notifications from YouTube subscription & publish to some spreadsheet by hand, which then propagates it all out
* Whatever you want. So long as it does not touch the existing game code, and so long as videos are available for any resource (user, game, etc).
